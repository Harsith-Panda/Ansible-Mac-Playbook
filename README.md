# Ansible-Mac-Playbook
This is my repo of ansible playbook just trying to automate my Mac setup process, this focuses mainly on installing applications from home-brew

I have used only homebrew function because I only want to automate the installation process and not the dock 
If you want to use dock also make sure to add in role ' - Dock '

# Thank You
